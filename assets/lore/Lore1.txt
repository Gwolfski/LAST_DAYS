The Removed (axe guy): not being intested in the art of chemestry the coned from masked socity roamed towards forbidden places, becoming part of the technoloy cults of the removers, most are addicted to insta-life, and the others breated it in through the fumes from the removers, and became addicted, they live inside their homes, either feeding off travelers or their farms, only attacking when tresspassed by someone who might be afficlated with the masked that once abandoned them.

the removers: the teachers of technology, leader of the removed, the removers are packed to the brim with insta-life, fumes coming off them, causing hallusanatory visions to their fellow outcastse, and deadly placebo effects to those without a form of respotory protection, chemists and preists they hold a special place in the removed culture, and killing them might just cause a little bit more chaos

Demons of the smoke(vex): a quote from a masked explorer: The creatures that came from his sleeves where black as the night sky, eyes as red as blood, they held weapons, some sort of hammer...was it teh one we used to knock them out? they flew through the walls, chased me though the building, i ran back home, I ran from them monsters, the demons of the smoke

O.I research stations:built prewar, by O.I these buildings where made to withstand a direct hit by a warhead, however time was not nice on these structures, and they now stand a husk of their former selves, rebuilt by the illagers they where perfect for hiding out and worshiping their gods, the wood rotting, the artwork wearing down on the old skeletons, its a wonder they havent joined the rest of the rubble...

Insta-life: from O.I BE commercial: Insta-life keeps you going, no matter what hits you, a bullet, HA you become a super hero with insta-life, never having to take a fall from the forces of nature herself! no more fearing whats around every cornor, with insta-life, your control death himself!
