
*O.I. Comprehensive Construction Kits - Concrete   
	Now featuring OI's new construction product, the CCK! CCK is a peculiar building material comprised of powdered concrete, miscelaneous debris, and machine parts. When it comes into contact with water, it oxidizes and the various machine parts activate and dissolve into the other materials. This alters their texture, pigments, and even molecular structure, resulting in anything from marble tiles to clay bricks, even steel plating depending on the machine parts used. OI had used it in the construction of the HIVES, but quickly learned that it was a lot more expensive than the metal plating they offically used.
